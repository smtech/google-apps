<p>Folks --</p>

<p>As the tech prefects told you in School Meeting this morning, we are getting ready to upgrade our email system to Gmail. There is an FAQ about that process below.</p>

<p>So that this process will go <i>smoothly</i>, I do need you to do something for me <b>as soon as you read this email.</b> Please try to open this shared document using your regular Gmail login (if you have one) or your regular St. Mark's login (if you have no Gmail address that you know of). It is a <b>GOOD THING</b> if you cannot log in. If you <i>can</i> login, there are some instructions in the document about what to do next.</p>

<h4 align="center"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rHI-i0J3E8-AxNIhgTW_hHUi4MtvvmW4rH06p1eci0k/edit?usp=sharing">Click this link to see the shared document.</a></h4>

<p>When you click the link above, you should see a login window like the one below on the left. When you can't log in, you should see the second screen, on the right. If you see these two screens in sequence, everything worked and you don't need to worry!</p>

<h3><a name="faq">St. Mark's Gmail FAQ</a></h3>

<dl>
<dt>When is this happening?</dt>
<dd>The actual change-over from our current Exchange server to Google Apps is planned for July 5. This date may change as we get deeper into the process, but our target is early July.</dd>

<dt>Will my email address change?</dt>
<dd>No. Even though we will be using Gmail for our email, your email address will remain the same (<a href="mailto:firstnamelastname@stmarksschool.org">firstnamelastname@stmarksschool.org</a>).</dd>

<dt>Will I lose my email (or calendars or contacts) because of this?</dt>
<dd>No. There may be a day or so when your email is unavailable around the actual changeover date, while various DNS servers update their records across the internet, and there may be several days while your old email is copied from our old server to the Google servers, but you will not lose any email or other data.</dd>

<dt>Will ____ change because of this?</dt>
<dd>It depends. If you use the Outlook application on either Mac or Windows (or any other email client application rather than going to <a href="http://mail.stmarksschool.org">http://mail.stmarksschool.org</a>), the only thing that will change is the settings required to connect to the email server. The interface will remain the same. If you use the webmail interface at <a href="http://mail.stmarksschool.org">http://mail.stmarksschool.org</a>, you will notice that the interface will change to be Gmail.</dd>

<dt>Seriously, will my access to school calendars or email lists change?</dt>
<dd>No. It really won't. The interface will improve if you access them through the <a href="http://mail.stmarksschool.org">webmail</a> interface, and it will be unchanged if you access them through the Outlook application.</dd>

<dt>Will there be training and support for this?</dt>
<dd>Yes. We will have updated mail settings for everyone before leaves campus at the end of the year. There will be FAQs and online courses available through Canvas, and in-person and webinar sessions available over the summer and into the school year.</dd>

<dt>I have a question that you didn't answer, who should I talk to?</dt>
<dd>Keith Host, Ken Griffin, Seth Battis or Brian Lester would be happy to answer any other questions you might have!</dd>
